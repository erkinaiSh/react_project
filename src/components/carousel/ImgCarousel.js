            <b>Balea Lake</b> - Balea Lake is a glacier lake in the Fagaras
            Mountains (not too far away from Poenari Castle), located in the
            central area of Romania. Anyone can easily rent a car in Romania and
            drive on the Transfagarasan Highway during the summer, and for the
            colder months, by cable car from Balea. Well worth the drive,
            everyone who visits is blown away by the stunning scenery. Stay in
            one of the few hotels in the area and visit the restaurants that
            allow you to look out onto rolling mountains and gleaming lake.

            <b>Poenari Castle</b> - If climbing almost 1,500 concrete steps on
            the way* to a quixotic castle sounds appealing, then Peonari Castle
            is a must see while in Romania. Not only does it offer a little
            adventure and ancient architecture, the cliff-side ruined castle has
            quite the blood-stained history attached to it. Poenari Castle can
            be found on the right side of the Transfagarasan Highway on a rock
            face near the Carpathian Mountains. Part of the castle was actually
            destroyed during a landslide back in the 1800's, but has been
            restored and maintained so that visitors can see it in all of its
            glory today.

            Timisoara is a must and number 7 on our list of places to visit in
            Romania. The charm of this city, which is located on the northern
            bank of the Bega River, lies in its distinct architectural character
            and vibrant cultural life. Most visitors find the locals calling it
            'Little Vienna,' which makes sense if you've seen the glistening
            city in Austria. Timisoara is home to some of the best musical and
            theatrical performances in Romania, as well as art galleries,
            museums, and a buzzing nightlife.

            as well as quaint hotels and many camp sites for the more slightly
            adventurous. Venerable motoring publication, Top Gear, called the
            Transfagarasan highway one of the best driving roads in the world,
            on par with Italy's famous Stelvio Pass, so if you're in the driving
            spirit, pick up a sports or luxury car rental and really let the
